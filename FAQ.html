            </div>
            <p>
                Frontend Practice is a collection of real and carefully chosen
                 websites for developers to recreate as a way to improve and test
                  their skills. We believe that a building from scratch approach will
                   teach you a multitude of skills, including design, interactions, 
                   animations, troubleshooting, responsiveness, and more.

                <h2>Why did you pick these websites?</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                Picking which websites to feature on Frontend
                Practice is a personal preference based on several factors, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Design & style</li>
                    <li>Difficulty to recreate</li>
                    <li>Elements & features that offer a leraning opportunity 
                        by recreating
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>*Some projects will be harder than others to recreate.</p>

                <h2>I'm stuck! Where is the code?</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                We try to provide a handful resources to help with projects but there
                will always be an unforeseen challenge. This is where learning really 
                begins. We recommend troubleshooting obstacles yourself or asking others
                for help. You may find using the developer tools on the live website very 
                helpful also.

                Both <a href="#">Pexels</a> & <a href="#">Pixabay</a> provide great
                free stock photos.

            <p>
                <a href="#">Boxicons</a> & <a href="#">Font Awesome</a> have a wide 
                of free icons.

            <p>
                How dare they update the website! We will talk with their manager
                 right away. If they don't respond, we'll periodically check the 
                 websites we feature and make the necessary updates.

            <p>
                We might keep some previous designs and link to an archived page if 
                we really love it.

                We would challenge you to make these projects your own by using your
                 choice of colors, content, and images. If you do decide to use these 
                 projects for a portfolio piece, please make it known that it is
                  "unofficial".

                These are practice projects and any and all materials owned by companies
